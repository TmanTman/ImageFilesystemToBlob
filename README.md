# README

This application demonstrates how to get load an in-memory blob from a filepath.

In this example, a filepath is generated by selecting an image from the gallery or taking a picture. Once the filepath is known,
the filepath is converted into a blob.

This was required in my case as I needed to included the Blob data in a custom file format that I am writing.

To get the project up and running:

Clone: $ git clone https://github.com/TmanTman/ImageFilesystemToBlob.git
Install dependencies: $ bower install
Install ngCordova according to instructions and install the image-picker plugin
Install the camera plugin: $ cordova plugin add https://github.com/TmanTman/cordova-plugin-wezka-nativecamera
